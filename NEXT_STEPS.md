### ‚ùå MISSING/INCOMPLETE FEATURES
- ‚úÖ **Service Routes Connected**: Service and service-category routes now connected to main API router (COMPLETED)
- ‚ùå **Booking System**: Database models exist but no API routes or UI
- ‚ùå **Payment Integration**: Payment models exist but no Paystack/Flutterwave integration
- ‚ùå **Review System**: Database model exists but no API or UI
- ‚ùå **Service Discovery UI**: Limited frontend components for browsing services
- ‚ùå **Real-time Features**: No WebSocket or real-time updates
- ‚úÖ **Database Seeding**: Sample data populated (COMPLETED)

## Phase 1: IMMEDIATE CRITICAL FIXES ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Priority 1: Connect Service API Routes ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Issue**: Service and service-category routes exist but are NOT connected to main API router
**Impact**: Frontend cannot access service data, browsing/booking is broken

**‚úÖ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION:**
- Added imports to `packages/api/src/app.ts`:
  ```typescript
  import { serviceCategoriesRouter } from "./routes/service-categories";
  import { servicesRouter } from "./routes/services";
  ```
- Added routes to appRouter chain:
  ```typescript
  .route("/service-categories", serviceCategoriesRouter)
  .route("/services", servicesRouter)
  ```

**‚úÖ RESULT**: Service API routes now fully functional at:
- `/api/service-categories` - List all service categories
- `/api/services` - Full CRUD operations for services

**Time Taken**: 5 minutes

### Priority 2: Database Seeding and Sample Data ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Issue**: Database needed proper user roles and verified data
**Impact**: Cannot test frontend service browsing, booking workflows

**‚úÖ COMPLETED DATA STATE:**
- ‚úÖ **6 Service Categories** populated (Academic Services, Beauty & Wellness, Event Services, Food & Delivery, Personal Services, Tech Support)
- ‚úÖ **18 Services** populated with proper provider relationships
- ‚úÖ **5 Test Users** with proper roles:
  - 3 PROVIDER users (with services linked)
  - 1 STUDENT user (student@uniben.edu)
  - 1 ADMIN user (admin@uniben.edu)
- ‚úÖ All users have `onboardingComplete: true`
- ‚úÖ Service-Provider-Category relationships verified

**Time Taken**: 25 minutes

## Phase 2: Core Booking System (Week 1-2)

### Priority 1: Booking API Routes ‚ùå MISSING
**Current State**: Database models exist (`booking`, `slot`, `payment`) but no API endpoints
**Needed**: Create `/packages/api/src/routes/bookings.ts`

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create booking CRUD endpoints (POST, GET, PUT /bookings)
2. Add availability checking with slot model
3. Implement booking status management (PENDING ‚Üí CONFIRMED ‚Üí COMPLETED)
4. Add provider availability management

**Database Models Available:**
- `booking` (id, studentId, providerId, serviceId, status, dateTime)
- `slot` (userId, dayOfWeek, startTime, endTime, isAvailable)
- `payment` (amount, currency, status, provider, bookingId)

### Priority 2: Booking UI Components ‚ùå MISSING
**Current State**: Basic service browsing exists, no booking interface
**Needed**: Create booking workflow components

1. Service booking form (datetime picker, payment method)
2. Provider availability calendar
3. Booking management dashboard (student + provider views)
4. Booking status tracking

## Phase 3: Payment Integration (Week 2-3)

### Priority 1: Paystack Integration ‚ùå NOT STARTED
**Current State**: Payment models exist, `packages/payments` exists but no Paystack
**Database Ready**: Payment table with PAYSTACK/FLUTTERWAVE enum

**Implementation:**
1. Install Paystack SDK in `packages/payments`
2. Create payment initialization endpoint
3. Add webhook handler for payment verification
4. Connect to booking workflow

### Priority 2: Payment UI ‚ùå NOT STARTED
1. Payment form component
2. Payment status tracking
3. Transaction history
4. Escrow status management

## Phase 4: Review and Rating System (Week 3-4)

### Priority 1: Review API ‚ùå MISSING
**Current State**: Database model exists (`review`) but no API endpoints
**Database Ready**: review (rating, comment, bookingId, authorId, targetId)

**Implementation:**
1. Create `/packages/api/src/routes/reviews.ts`
2. Add review CRUD endpoints
3. Link to completed bookings
4. Calculate average ratings for providers/services

### Priority 2: Review UI Components ‚ùå MISSING
1. Rating submission form (post-booking)
2. Review display components
3. Provider rating aggregation
4. Review moderation (admin)

## Phase 5: Enhanced Features (Week 4+)

### Service Discovery Improvements
- [ ] Advanced search with filters (price, rating, category)
- [ ] Service image galleries
- [ ] Provider portfolios
- [ ] Location-based search
- [ ] Recommendation engine

### Real-time Features
- [ ] Live booking notifications
- [ ] Chat/messaging system
- [ ] Real-time availability updates
- [ ] Push notifications

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED ACTION PLAN (45 minutes)

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Connect Service API Routes (5 minutes) - COMPLETED
**File**: `/packages/api/src/app.ts`
**‚úÖ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION:**
```typescript
// Added imports at top
import { serviceCategoriesRouter } from "./routes/service-categories";
import { servicesRouter } from "./routes/services";

// Added to appRouter chain
.route("/service-categories", serviceCategoriesRouter)
.route("/services", servicesRouter)
```

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Database with Test Data (25 minutes) - COMPLETED
**‚úÖ COMPLETED DATA:**
- 6 Service Categories populated
- 18 Services with provider relationships
