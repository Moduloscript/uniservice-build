## Phase 1: IMMEDIATE CRITICAL FIXES ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Priority 1: Connect Service API Routes ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Issue**: Service and service-category routes exist but are NOT connected to main API router
**Impact**: Frontend cannot access service data, browsing/booking is broken

**‚úÖ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION:**
- Added imports to `packages/api/src/app.ts`:
  ```typescript
  import { serviceCategoriesRouter } from "./routes/service-categories";
  import { servicesRouter } from "./routes/services";
  ```
- Added routes to appRouter chain:
  ```typescript
  .route("/service-categories", serviceCategoriesRouter)
  .route("/services", servicesRouter)
  ```

**‚úÖ RESULT**: Service API routes now fully functional at:
- `/api/service-categories` - List all service categories
- `/api/services` - Full CRUD operations for services

**Time Taken**: 5 minutes

### Priority 2: Database Seeding and Sample Data ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Issue**: Database needed proper user roles and verified data
**Impact**: Cannot test frontend service browsing, booking workflows

**‚úÖ COMPLETED DATA STATE:**
- ‚úÖ **6 Service Categories** populated (Academic Services, Beauty & Wellness, Event Services, Food & Delivery, Personal Services, Tech Support)
- ‚úÖ **18 Services** populated with proper provider relationships
- ‚úÖ **5 Test Users** with proper roles:
  - 3 PROVIDER users (with services linked)
  - 1 STUDENT user (student@uniben.edu)
  - 1 ADMIN user (admin@uniben.edu)
- ‚úÖ All users have `onboardingComplete: true`
- ‚úÖ Service-Provider-Category relationships verified

**Time Taken**: 25 minutes

## Phase 2: Core Booking System (Week 1-2)

2. ‚úÖ Role-based access control (STUDENT can create/cancel, PROVIDER can confirm/complete, ADMIN has full access)
3. ‚úÖ Booking status management (PENDING ‚Üí CONFIRMED ‚Üí COMPLETED ‚Üí CANCELLED)
4. ‚úÖ Input validation and error handling
5. ‚úÖ Connected to main API router at `/api/bookings`

**Database Models Available:**

- `payment` (amount, currency, status, provider, bookingId)

### Priority 2: Booking UI Components ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Current State**: ‚úÖ Complete booking interface with role-based functionality

**Current State**: Payment models exist, `packages/payments` exists but no Paystack
**Database Ready**: Payment table with PAYSTACK/FLUTTERWAVE enum

**Implementation:**
1. Install Paystack SDK in `packages/payments`
2. Create payment initialization endpoint
3. Add webhook handler for payment verification
4. Connect to booking workflow

### Priority 2: Payment UI ‚ùå NOT STARTED
1. Payment form component
2. Payment status tracking
3. Transaction history
4. Escrow status management

## Phase 4: Review and Rating System (Week 3-4)

### Priority 1: Review API ‚ùå MISSING

**Implementation:**
1. Create `/packages/api/src/routes/reviews.ts`
2. Add review CRUD endpoints
3. Link to completed bookings
4. Calculate average ratings for providers/services

### Priority 2: Review UI Components ‚ùå MISSING
