# Implementation Memory Log

## [2025-05-15] Prisma Configuration Review and Enhancement

**Related Task(s):**
- TASKS.md > Phase 1: Foundation Setup > 1.1 Database & Schema

**Current State Analysis:**
1. Existing Prisma setup found in:
   - `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`
   - `packages/database/src/client.ts`
   - `packages/database/src/zod/index.ts`

**What was reviewed:**
1. Current Schema Configuration:
   - PostgreSQL database provider
   - Prisma Client generator
   - Zod generator for type safety
   - JSON generator for JSON fields
   - Basic User model with authentication fields

2. Existing Models:
   - User
   - Session
   - Account
   - Verification
   - Passkey
   - Organization
   - Member
   - Invitation
   - Purchase
   - AiChat

**What needs to be added:**
1. New Models for UnibenServices:
   ```prisma
   model Student {
     id            String    @id
     matricNumber  String    @unique
     email        String    @unique
     name         String
     department   String
     level        Int
     bookings     Booking[]
     reviews      Review[]
   }

   model ServiceProvider {
     id          String    @id
     name        String
     services    Service[]
     availability Slot[]
     reviews     Review[]
   }
   ```

**Decisions:**
1. Reuse existing User model as base:
   - Extend User model instead of creating separate Student/Provider models
   - Add role-based fields to User model
   - Use relations to link specialized profiles

2. Database Client:
   - Keep existing singleton pattern in `src/client.ts`
   - Maintain current error handling

3. Type Generation:
   - Continue using Zod generator
   - Keep JSON type support

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Extend existing schema:
   - Add service-specific fields to User model
   - Create service-related models
   - Maintain existing auth-related fields

2. Update generators:
   - Keep current configuration
   - Ensure Zod types are generated for new models

3. Migration strategy:
   - Create new migration for service-specific changes
   - Preserve existing user data

**Blockers/Notes:**
1. Need to ensure compatibility with:
   - Existing auth setup in `packages/auth`
   - Current user management flows
   - Existing session handling

2. Questions to resolve:
   - How to handle user role transitions (student to provider)?
   - Strategy for handling verified status across roles

**Next Steps:**
1. Create migration for schema updates
2. Update type definitions
3. Test compatibility with auth system
4. Document new models and relationships

**References:**
- Existing schema: `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Client setup: `packages/database/src/client.ts`
- Type generation: `packages/database/src/zod/index.ts`
- Auth integration: `packages/auth/auth.ts`
