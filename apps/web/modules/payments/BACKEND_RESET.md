# Payment Backend Reset Documentation

This document tracks the changes made to clear backend logic from the payment components.

## Date: 2025-01-26

### Components Modified:

1. **payment-processor.tsx**
   - Removed all API calls to `paymentsApi.initiatePayment()` and `paymentsApi.verifyPayment()`
   - Removed polling logic for payment verification
   - Added placeholder messages for payment initialization
   - Kept UI structure intact for future implementation

2. **api.ts**
   - Removed all actual API client calls
   - Replaced with placeholder functions that log and throw errors
   - Kept function signatures and types intact
   - Added mock data return for `getPaymentMethods()` to support UI development

3. **payment-retry.tsx**
   - Removed backend API call to `/api/payments/initiate-payment`
   - Replaced with placeholder retry logic
   - Kept UI structure and failure reason handling intact

### Components NOT Modified:

1. **payment-method-selector.tsx** - No backend logic present
2. **payment-success.tsx** - No backend logic present
3. **Type definitions** - Kept all types intact for future use

### Next Steps:

When ready to implement the backend:

1. Replace placeholder functions in `api.ts` with actual API client calls
2. Implement the payment initialization logic in `payment-processor.tsx`
3. Implement the retry logic in `payment-retry.tsx`
4. Add proper error handling and state management
5. Test the complete payment flow end-to-end

### Backend Endpoints Needed:

- `POST /api/payments/enhanced/initiate` - Initialize a payment
- `POST /api/payments/enhanced/verify` - Verify a payment
- `GET /api/payments/status/:bookingId` - Get payment status
- `GET /api/payments/methods` - Get available payment methods

All frontend components are now ready for UI development without backend dependencies.
